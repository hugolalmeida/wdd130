        <h2>Hugo Leonardo</h2>
        <p>Hello World!</p>
        <p>
            My name is Hugo Leonardo, you can call me Hugo as well.<br>
            I am from Brazil and served a mission as a missionary of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Days Saints on
            Brazil Fortaleza mission and could learn and teach about the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
        <p>
            I started a programming degree a few time ago and I am loving do this course, for while I am learning the
            basic of python programming language and the basic of web development and html language, for while I know
            only about java programming language, but I want to learn more and more about programming and work with it.
            I really like to study as an online student, but one day I want to try the Campus, to know more people and
            learn more.<br>
            BYU Pathway and BYU-I is helping a lot with learning. As an online student I have too much resources that
            help me to get a good education and knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            I like to play games and sports, I already did play soccer, basketball, table tennis, ski, skateboard and
            longboard, and I want to play too much more sports as possible.
